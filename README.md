## Backup Media Syncer

### Requirements
This program has only been tested with python 3.x.  It'll probably work with python 2.x with minior modifications.

### How-to
* First, rename `_media_merge.py` to either `_movie_merge.py` or `_show_merge.py`.  
* Place the file you just renamed into the backup directory.
* Then, set the root origin directory for your movies and tv shows by editing lines 7 and 8 of the file you just renamed.  Run the file.
* It'll create three files on your desktop (you can change this destination by editing line 6).  
 * The first two files just list the contnets of your origin and backup directories (you can use a diff comparison to see what the differances are, if you'd like). 
 * The third file is a custom diff file which the program generated that notes the origin directory, the backup directory, and all the files that are new in the origin dir and need to be deleted from the backup dir.
* Look over all the proposed changes in the diff file.  If there are any changes that you don't want made, simply delete that line.
* When you are satisfied with the proposed changes, run the `_sync.py` file.

### Notes

* This program assumes that if the filenames is the same, then so are the file (I may add hashing or modified date comparison in the future).
* `_media_merge.py`
 * Line 6 controls the log directory.
 * Line 7 controls the origin root directory.
 * Line 8 controls the backup directory.
 * Line 21 controls the extension blacklist that won't be synced.
 * Lines 68 through 77 are what force `_media_merge.py` to be in the backup directory.  Modifying that will change the behavior.
* `_sync.py`
 * Assumes that the the log files were saved to the user's desktop.
 * Relies on the diff file generated by the renamed `_media_merge.py`.
 * Creates a log file on the desktop that outlines the changes madee.
